# Decision making skills

This recherche decribes overview of decision making process with related skills needed. Whole process is decomposed to sub-areas with examples to cover them.
From my point of view making decision is equal to how to solve the problem so problem solving techniques can used to making decision.
As an example I use - make a decision how to name the new application.

Following paragraph contains general decision making process decomposition with suggested techniques how to cover each sub-part. Most important techniques are decribed more in detail below.

# Decision making (= problem solving) general process:
1. Clearly define the decision which needs to be make.
   * Definition has to contain also limitations if they are present. Budget, time, resources.
2. Collecting ideas - brainstorming
3. Ideas categorization - affinitity diagrams, voting
4. Category description - mind mapping, group passing
5. Evaluate final decision (= problem root cause) - fishbone diagram, interrelationship diagram, 5 whys
