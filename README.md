# Decision making skills

This recherche decribes overview of decision making process with related skills needed. Whole process is decomposed to sub-areas with examples to cover them.
From my point of view making decision is equal to how to solve the problem so problem solving techniques can used to making decision.
As an example I use - make a decision how to name the new application.

Following paragraph contains general decision making process decomposition with suggested techniques how to cover each sub-part. Most important techniques are decribed more in detail below.

# Decision making (= problem solving) general process:
1. Clearly define the decision which needs to be make.
   * Definition has to contain also limitations if they are present. Budget, time, resources.
2. Collecting ideas - brainstorming
3. Ideas categorization - affinitity diagrams, voting
4. Category description - mind mapping, group passing
5. Evaluate final decision (= problem root cause) - fishbone diagram, interrelationship diagram, 5 whys

## Application on example how to name the new applicaiton
1. We need to decide the name for new application.
    * Application manages sharing cars. Selecting, using, paying.
    * The name shouldn't be related to any animal, already used, longer than 8 characters.
    * The name shouldn't contain punctuation
    * The name should be well pronounced
2. Write down names which comes to your mind
3. Categorize them by kind of use. As category name use kind of use, specific name or composition of initial letters
4. Write down category name and limitations on cards, make arrow connection between limitation and category name if matching. Category name with most connections is selected name => final decision.

TODO list specific techniques, add used techniques to example.
